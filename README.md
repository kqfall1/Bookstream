The web application is now in a more-or-less stable state. There are only a few minor bugs left and 
all core use cases have been implemented and tested. Unfortunately, the Google Books API integration 
appears to have broken when the application was deployed. It's acceptable for now though, because future expansion should call for integration with multiple other book APIs for redundancy and optimal UX. 
Future expansion should also plan for the decoupling of the search bar from the BookList component, 
user account and order management features, and administration capabilities. 

I think that the team here at React Raiders has done an excellent job in developing this application, 
despite undeniable friction and some setbacks. We all look forward to building on the skills we 
developed while collaborating with each other here. Thanks again, team.
